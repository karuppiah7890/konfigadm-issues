Set ntp/chronyd - https://github.com/flanksource/konfigadm/issues/13

Acceptance criteria:

Want the ability to make sure it is installed, and specify the ntp servers to use. Like this

```yaml
ntp:
  - ntp.ubuntu.org
  - ntp.1.ubunutu.org
```

This would ensure that ntpd is installed, and the service is enabled and running, with the specified servers configured in ntp.conf

----------

chronyd? not needed. we can start with ntp. chrony is more specific to rhel, and we don't have e2e setup for rhel yet

----------

tasks:
1. install ntp server in ubuntu

https://vitux.com/how-to-install-ntp-server-and-client-on-ubuntu/

```
$ sudo apt install ntp
```

2. configure some ntp servers. how to check if the configuration is working?

```
$ sudo vi /etc/ntp.conf
```

https://www.ntppool.org/en/
https://www.ntppool.org/zone
https://www.ntppool.org/zone/@
https://www.ntppool.org/zone/asia
https://www.ntppool.org/zone/in

```
server 0.in.pool.ntp.org
server 1.in.pool.ntp.org
server 2.in.pool.ntp.org
server 3.in.pool.ntp.org
```

```
$ sudo service ntp restart
$ sudo service ntp status
```

To print a list of the peers

```
$ ntpq -p
```

what about configuration of NTP clients? defer it for now..

3. write code to install ntp (looks like it's usually already installed) and to configure
it using /etc/ntp.conf

- check where is the code to install other packages
- how is the installation happening?
- how is the declarativeness maintained or done?
- add code for ntp installation
- check if there's any code to configure software using files
- how is the declarativeness maintained or done?


-----

there is some code for installing packages here and there already.

pkg/types/packages.go
pkg/phases/packages.go

to know supported OSes and base OSes , check here
pkg/phases/os.go

on checking how the packages are installed, I used the execution of the apply command
to see how it happened. this is what I found till now -

the command I executed is this -

```
$ sudo konfigadm apply -c - <<-EOF
kubernetes:
  version: 1.17.2
container_runtime:
  type: docker
commands:
  - kubeadm init
EOF
```

from this, it was able to read from the standard input and install a lot of packages. how ?

first the file to start checking is here - 
cmd/apply.go

the config flag is defined here at root level
main.go

using the flag value(s), the GetConfig over here
cmd/common.go

is called to get the configuration

In our case, we didn't use other flags, so I think it's mostly this code for config

```
cfg, err := types.NewConfig(append(configs, args...)...).
		WithVars(vars...).
		WithFlags(flags...).
		Build()
```

it looks like a builder pattern? the main function to look for is Build() here
pkg/types/builder.go

here, each config from the config(s) is taken and then merged into one, using ImportConfig() func calls
over here
pkg/types/config.go

Now, the Config struct here
pkg/types/types.go

already has NTP field in it! so NTP can already be read!

but in the ImportConfig() method, NTP was not considered at all for the merge. So I added this code

But hey, I wanted to add tests for this too. To make sure that everything is tested and works too. TDD!
So I removed the one line of code I added and started looking for tests! And then found this

test/merge_test.go

Added a small test there after creating a fixture file here
fixtures/ntp.yml

Need to understand what fixture means and how it all works here, but I wrote a failing test and then
passed it too! :D

Next in line is to make sure that, when ntp config is given, make sure ntp is installed
and configured too with the given set of ntp servers! :D
