Set ntp/chronyd - https://github.com/flanksource/konfigadm/issues/13

Acceptance criteria:

Want the ability to make sure it is installed, and specify the ntp servers to use. Like this

```yaml
ntp:
  - ntp.ubuntu.org
  - ntp.1.ubunutu.org
```

This would ensure that ntpd is installed, and the service is enabled and running, with the specified servers configured in ntp.conf

----------

chronyd? not needed. we can start with ntp. chrony is more specific to rhel, and we don't have e2e setup for rhel yet

----------

tasks:
1. install ntp server in ubuntu

https://vitux.com/how-to-install-ntp-server-and-client-on-ubuntu/

```
$ sudo apt install ntp
```

2. configure some ntp servers. how to check if the configuration is working?

```
$ sudo vi /etc/ntp.conf
```

https://www.ntppool.org/en/
https://www.ntppool.org/zone
https://www.ntppool.org/zone/@
https://www.ntppool.org/zone/asia
https://www.ntppool.org/zone/in

```
server 0.in.pool.ntp.org
server 1.in.pool.ntp.org
server 2.in.pool.ntp.org
server 3.in.pool.ntp.org
```

```
$ sudo service ntp restart
$ sudo service ntp status
```

To print a list of the peers

```
$ ntpq -p
```

what about configuration of NTP clients? defer it for now..

3. write code to install ntp (looks like it's usually already installed) and to configure
it using /etc/ntp.conf

- check where is the code to install other packages
- how is the installation happening?
- how is the declarativeness maintained or done?
- add code for ntp installation
- check if there's any code to configure software using files
- how is the declarativeness maintained or done?
