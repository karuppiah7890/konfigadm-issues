Set ntp/chronyd - https://github.com/flanksource/konfigadm/issues/13

Acceptance criteria:

Want the ability to make sure it is installed, and specify the ntp servers to use. Like this

```yaml
ntp:
  - ntp.ubuntu.org
  - ntp.1.ubunutu.org
```

This would ensure that ntpd is installed, and the service is enabled and running, with the specified servers configured in ntp.conf

----------

chronyd? not needed. we can start with ntp. chrony is more specific to rhel, and we don't have e2e setup for rhel yet

----------

tasks:
1. install ntp server in ubuntu

https://vitux.com/how-to-install-ntp-server-and-client-on-ubuntu/

```
$ sudo apt install ntp
```

2. configure some ntp servers. how to check if the configuration is working?

```
$ sudo vi /etc/ntp.conf
```

https://www.ntppool.org/en/
https://www.ntppool.org/zone
https://www.ntppool.org/zone/@
https://www.ntppool.org/zone/asia
https://www.ntppool.org/zone/in

```
server 0.in.pool.ntp.org
server 1.in.pool.ntp.org
server 2.in.pool.ntp.org
server 3.in.pool.ntp.org
```

```
$ sudo service ntp restart
$ sudo service ntp status
```

To print a list of the peers

```
$ ntpq -p
```

what about configuration of NTP clients? defer it for now..

3. write code to install ntp (looks like it's usually already installed) and to configure
it using /etc/ntp.conf

- check where is the code to install other packages
- how is the installation happening?
- how is the declarativeness maintained or done?
- add code for ntp installation
- check if there's any code to configure software using files


-----

there is some code for installing packages here and there already.

pkg/types/packages.go
pkg/phases/packages.go

to know supported OSes and base OSes , check here
pkg/phases/os.go

on checking how the packages are installed, I used the execution of the apply command
to see how it happened. this is what I found till now -

the command I executed is this -

```
$ sudo konfigadm apply -c - <<-EOF
kubernetes:
  version: 1.17.2
container_runtime:
  type: docker
commands:
  - kubeadm init
EOF
```

from this, it was able to read from the standard input and install a lot of packages. how ?

first the file to start checking is here - 
cmd/apply.go

the config flag is defined here at root level
main.go

using the flag value(s), the GetConfig over here
cmd/common.go

is called to get the configuration

In our case, we didn't use other flags, so I think it's mostly this code for config

```
cfg, err := types.NewConfig(append(configs, args...)...).
		WithVars(vars...).
		WithFlags(flags...).
		Build()
```

it looks like a builder pattern? the main function to look for is Build() here
pkg/types/builder.go

here, each config from the config(s) is taken and then merged into one, using ImportConfig() func calls
over here
pkg/types/config.go

Now, the Config struct here
pkg/types/types.go

already has NTP field in it! so NTP can already be read!

but in the ImportConfig() method, NTP was not considered at all for the merge. So I added this code

But hey, I wanted to add tests for this too. To make sure that everything is tested and works too. TDD!
So I removed the one line of code I added and started looking for tests! And then found this

test/merge_test.go

Added a small test there after creating a fixture file here
fixtures/ntp.yml

Need to understand what fixture means and how it all works here, but I wrote a failing test and then
passed it too! :D

Next in line is to make sure that, when ntp config is given, make sure ntp is installed
and configured too with the given set of ntp servers! :D

Wow, okay, looks like there's a lot of code to do a lot of things. So, today, on digging some code
for apply command, I found out some more stuff -

The ApplyPhases() method on Config does a lot of stuff! It's here
pkg/types/config.go

To start with, there are phases. On checking where all the phases are, I found it here
finally
pkg/phases.go

And as you can see, there's order to it, and it works in that order. Example, Kubernetes
comes first, and Packages come later

And kubernetes is an app, packages is not

On checking the methods on these phases, I checked ApplyPhase method, as that's what is
called in ApplyPhases function.

for kubernetes, it does some stuff based on the OS, over here
pkg/apps/kubernetes.go in ApplyPhase function

You can see how OS based packages are added and file system stuff is also done
And you can also see that ntp is installed too!

In our case, for our issue, we still have to install it - because it's not
necessary that our user will be installing kubernetes. If they simply give
ntp config, only that will be installed and configured. 

The systemd config to run it is here

```
$ cat /lib/systemd/system/ntp.service
[Unit]
Description=Network Time Service
Documentation=man:ntpd(8)
After=network.target
Conflicts=systemd-timesyncd.service

[Service]
Type=forking
# Debian uses a shell wrapper to process /etc/default/ntp
# and select DHCP-provided NTP servers if available
ExecStart=/usr/lib/ntp/ntp-systemd-wrapper
PrivateTmp=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

In fedora, it can be installed via

```
$ yum install ntp
```

and the configuration was at `/etc/ntp.conf`


Now, looks like this is what I gotta do - create a ntp.go near kubernetes.go 
May be add some tests? And create a Apply phase, verify phase? and then add the ntp
phase to the list of phases! 

To install ntp -> install ntp package, add systemd config, add a config file - actually, overwrite
the existing file that came with installation. should we add all the default config along with
the ntp servers? should it be templatized or something? hmm. may be ;) let's see...

or we can append to the config file? :) But there's no provision for that now, I think

For now, let's write to the file. We can append later! :)

Now, in our test, what should we test?
1. We need to have ntp package installed, so that should be there in the packages list
  a. there should be one package - done
  b. the package should have flags - what flags? DEBIAN_LIKE or what? both debian and ubuntu
     have that tag as common. choosing DEBIAN_LIKE for now :) we are supporting only Ubuntu and Debian for
     now - done
2. We need to add a systemd config file. so that should be there in the file system - actually, the installation itself adds it in ubuntu. so, let's not add it now may be?
3. We need to add a ntp config file. so that should be there in the file system - done
4. We need to run some commands to start/restart ntp service. so that should be there in the commands - done














To Do Later:
1. Append to the ntp.conf file instead of overwriting it
2. Support Fedora
3. add systemd config file if it's not present - it was noticed in fedora that
  systemd file was not there and service was not started. so, we need to run systemctl start command
  too. all this only for fedora. not sure about others.
